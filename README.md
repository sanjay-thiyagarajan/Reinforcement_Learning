# Reinforcement Learning - A Beginner's perspective

## 1) What is Reinforcement Learning ?
Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning that focuses on how you, or how some thing, might act in an environment in order to maximize some given reward. Reinforcement learning algorithms study the behavior of subjects in such environments and learn to optimize that behavior.

## 2) Purpose of Writeup
I made this repo to hold my notes while learning Reinforcement Learning which could help absolute beginners to get used to RL and its popular algorithms.
